# How to set up to join **The Laurel Project** community

:::

## Intro

Welcome and congrats on your initiative to join our community!
Those are the necessary steps to be ready to receive Laurels (The Laurel Project's crypto coin), and at the end of that journey, you will receive your first (of many üòé) Laurels.

## Prepare your Wallet

1. Create an Ethereum Wallet (if you already has one, you can skip this step)
   - Install the google chrome extension [metamask](https://metamask.io/download.html) and create an account there.
   - At the end, you will have your key number (looks like 0x90F79bf6EB2c4f870365E785982E1f101E93b906), you can access your number by clicking on the MetaMask extension, like this image below:

     :::

- To now on, let's refer to this number as **laurel-key**
- **Note**: The Laurel cryptocurrency uses the same technology as Ethereum, but does not have a monetary value. The only way of trade this coin is earning it doing volunteer work (the value of one Laurel is one minute of your service doing good to others/ the world)

2. Connect the Ethereum Wallet with our test network named **The Laurel: Rinkeby** - In the Metamask extension, change the network, as the image below:

- If you already know you to do that check https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/YOUR-LAUREL-KEY. You should have 0.2 rETH
  - If you do not, first try to connect [here](https://www.ethily.io/rinkeby-faucet/)
  - If doesn't work automatically, you need to validate with [this tool](https://faucet.rinkeby.io/). After that go back to the previous step and try to connect again.
    - That is a little weird because you need to copy the code and post it publicly on Twitter or Facebook, but it is only for validation purposes (after you post, copy the public link of your post and past on the validator tool) after the validation complete you can delete the public post üòÅ

## Join the Community

1.  Create a GitHub account if you do not have: https://github.com/ (sorry, another account üòÖ)
2.  In this platform, we have a repository where you have to add some data (in just ONE pull request)
    - Add a line in format **laurel-key**: _your profile name_ in [this .json document](https://github.com/the-laurel/laurels/blob/main/data/volunteersMap.json)
    - Add an image **laurel-key**.png in [this folder](https://github.com/the-laurel/laurels/tree/main/data/images)

- Note: If you do not know how to create a Pull Request: while logged into GitHub, click on the edit button from https://github.com/the-laurel/laurels/blob/main/data/volunteersMap.json. This will fork the project on your account and you can start editing. Commit your changes to a branch. Upload your avatar on that branch. You will see a create Pull Request button under the "Contribute" dropdown - click on it.

## Make your first contribution

- Ask another volunteer to be your ancestor in the system and register you (provide your **laurel-key**), and choose one of the above to do.
  - Retweet 5 tweets from @provable_laurel or another volunteer's tweets that are related to The Laurel and the technical projects developed under The Laurel (e.g. @lorecirstea)
  - Write a social media post (Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, Linkedin) saying what inspired you to join The Laurel and what your expectations/hopes are. We expect it to be honest and factually correct
  - Ask 5 questions about The Laurel Project and/or protocol, as comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/provable_laurel/comments/pt3opa/the_laurel_project_and_protocol_qa/) or other posts
  - Post a detailed first sight feedback [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/provable_laurel/comments/pt3vus/at_first_sight_no1/)
- After done, let him/her know. Then wait for your ancestor to generate the validate link and click it

  :::
- The page will looks like as the page above, in this link you should put the actual proof of you did (in this case the link of the post, but in the future can be any other proof) and then click in **create proof url**
